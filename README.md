### Use Case 1

Name: Jace
Age: 22
Location: Chicago
Jace is a 22-year-old artist. Jace logs in to the website and can now modify his website in different ways. He can choose to modify his blog posts and songs.
Uploading a new song:
Jace clicks the add a new song button. He is taken to a page where he can upload an audio file from his computer.
Deleting a song:
Jace clicks an edit button near the songs. This action causes delete buttons to appear by each song.
Modifying blog posts:
From the home page, Jace can create a new blog. He can add a title, a body and an image.
Jace can also edit a previously posted blog and even delete blogs.

### Use Case 2

Name: Chris
Name: Chris
Age: 21
Location: Chicago
Chris is a local music enthusiast. He is active on social media sites. He follows many hip-hop blogs like Pigeons and Planes and Fakeshore Drive.
Chris can go to Jace’s site to view blog posts, listen to songs, and share content on his social media. In this case, Chris lands on the homepage where he listens to a few songs.
Chris then shares Jace’s site on his twitter account. Chris also browses through some of the blog posts and decides to sign up for the mailing list to receive updates on new content.
Chris can also follow the links to Jace’s social media accounts.

## Technologies

The website will follow a more traditional method of deploying websites.
The client side technologies will be HTML CSS and JavaScript. Java will be used on the server side.
I am also planning on using one of the Database as a service for example Amazon’s DynamoDB.
